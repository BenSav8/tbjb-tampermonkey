# TBJB Tampermonkey Port
tampermonkey port for TBJB made by @dell-optiplex-790\n
since the TBJB vulnerability was fixed, you can now use this tampermonkey userscript to be able to use TBJB\n
to use it, copy and paste the contents of [userscript.js](https://github.com/BenSav8/tbjb-tampermonkey/blob/main/userscript.js) into tampermonkey, save it, then turn the userscript on\n
after doing so, you may refresh trollbox and it should have installed TBJB
